##  Linear Regression to Predict MPG
### Deliverable 1:
The data was ´MechaCar_mpg.csv´. From that data we can see by running a multinomial linear regresion that the variables that best help predict MPG are: vehicle_length and ground_clearance considering a 95% confidence level. Because we can see a relationship among these variables; we wouldn´t be able to confirm that the slope=0. In addition, we have a multiple R-squared=0.71 suggesting that some of the variables used can help predict MPG effectively.
