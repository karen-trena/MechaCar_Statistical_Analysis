##  Linear Regression to Predict MPG
### Deliverable 1:
The data was MechaCar_mpg.csv. From that data we can see by running a multinomial linear regresion that the variables that best help predict MPG are: vehicle_length and ground_clearance considering a 95% confidence level. Because we can see a relationship among these variables; we wouldnÂ´t be able to confirm that the slope=0. In addition, we have a multiple R-squared=0.71 suggesting that some of the variables used can help predict MPG effectively.
The information can be confirmed in this picture:

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
### Deliverable 2:
The PSI values were summarized with the mean, median, variance, and stdev. From those numbers we can see that variance doesnt exceed 100 pounds per each square inch, so we are good on it:

However, we did the same analysis by lot. We can see that Lot3 exceeds the number up to 170.
